	<p class="description">Cats, also called domestic cats (Felis catus), are carnivorous (meat-eating) mammals, of the family Felidae.

Cats have been domesticated (tame) for nearly 10,000 years.[1] They are currently the most popular pets in the world.[2] Their origin is probably the African Wildcat Felis silvestris lybica.
Cats were probably first kept because they ate mice, and this is still their main 'job' in farms throughout the world. Later they were kept because they are friendly and good companions.
